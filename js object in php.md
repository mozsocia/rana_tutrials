Let me explain how to work with key-value pairs in PHP arrays, contrasting it with JavaScript objects.

In PHP, associative arrays serve the same purpose as JavaScript objects when it comes to storing key-value pairs. Here's a comparison:

JavaScript:
```javascript
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30
};
```

PHP:
```php
$person = array(
    "name" => "John",
    "age" => 30
);

// Modern PHP (5.4+) also supports this shorter syntax:
$person = [
    "name" => "John",
    "age" => 30
];
```

To access values in PHP:
```php
// Access values
echo $person["name"];  // Output: John

// Add new key-value pair
$person["city"] = "New York";

// Modify existing value
$person["age"] = 31;

// Check if key exists
if (array_key_exists("name", $person)) {
    echo "Name exists in array";
}
```

One key difference to note is that PHP uses the `=>` operator to associate keys with values, and square brackets `[]` for accessing values, instead of the dot notation we commonly use in JavaScript.

Would you like me to explain any specific operations with PHP associative arrays in more detail?
